Hi! My name is Aya. 
I'm currently on a journey of changing careers and exploring opportunities in tech by immersing myself in code and learning as much as I can about it. Before embarking on this journey, with my degree in finance, after college, I managed to land a job for a bank's treasury management department as a part of their operations team. After a couple of years of doing that, I quit my job and decided to enroll myself in a UX Design Bootcamp. After learning about what UX was all about and then realizng that it iasn't what I thought it was, I withdrew from the bootcamp and got really interested instead in UI and how it's built (front-end engineering). I'm still figuring it out and know that I havve a long way to go, but I'm enjoying the process. I'm learning so much, everyday. And I know it's going to be worth it.
